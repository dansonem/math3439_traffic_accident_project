# math3439_traffic_accident_project
Jupyter notebooks and other materials for the fourth project in my data science course, using different prediction modeling platforms to predict the severity of traffic accidents.

Using a traffic accident dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents), we predicted the severity of traffic accidents on a scale of 1-4. We compared the ease of use and accuracy of results from VertexAI's AutoML modeling, decision trees with scikit learn packages, and InterpretML's 'glass box'. More information can be found in the project proposal, presentation, and article.
