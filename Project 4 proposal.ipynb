Talk about the parts you think will be difficult (doing the modeling? preparing the data? keeping team members on-task?) and how you plan to address them. Specifically list out goals for yourself in terms of these challenges. I will check in with you throughout the semester on how you are progressing with these goals in order to help you succeed. Talk about why each team member was given each of their duties and responsibilities. Talk about your overall goals for the project. What are the things you are hoping to accomplish for this project to be considered a success? Is it an accuracy goal? Is it being able to explain a complex question in an easy way? Is it to add new insight to an important problem? Be as specific as possible. During your final presentation I will be looking for whether or not you achieved these goals, so they must be clearly defined and not overly broad."],"metadata":{"id":"V6gc4aX26uKZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Being the final project with a 1 GB dataset, there will definitely be some challenges. Some parts of data preparation may be difficult, as we decide how to handle null values, and potentially reduce the number of factors in certain columns. For example, the weather condition column has many entries with 'rainy' and 'clear', but there are some strange ones like 'volcanic ash' that only have 1 entry, and these may work better as an 'other' factor or by grouping them in with the closest matching common option. I expect that we will have some difficulties with Google's AutoML since we haven't used it before. I also think that the open-endedness of the project means that we don't have the most straightforward path to completing it.\n","\n","Our goal is to successfully predict accident severity using Vertex AI from Google Cloud. We will compare the accuracy to models we build in Google Collab, which will likely be some form of gradient boosting. We will also compare the experiences of using these different platforms. Finally, if time permits, we would like to explore an alternate model-building platform, such as TensorFlow or InterpretML glassbox, and see how this compares as well.\n","\n","Duties were assigned after discussing with team members, and will change as needed.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"CVgu_oKyojf6"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Approved by Dr. Savala on: XX/XX/XXXX"],"metadata":{"id":"vVcSFuoXmmiy"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Schedule\n","\n","Monday, Apr 17:\n","- Teams present on their topic, along with initial results (~10 minutes each)\n","\n","Friday, Apr 21:\n","- Teams present progress on their project\n","\n","Wednesday, May 3, 9am-11am:\n","- Project 4 presentations"],"metadata":{"id":"W9P9TduaM6uM"}}]}
